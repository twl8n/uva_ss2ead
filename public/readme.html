Introduction
------------

This package is a standard Rails application. Only files which differ
from what you get with a stock Rails application have been checked
into the repository. There are also two command line scripts as
well. The main purpose of uva_ss2ead is to convert .xlsx with a
certain column layout into EAD XML.  EAD xml.

The blank spreadsheet is in public/ead_template.xlsx.

show_ss.rb exists to display a spreadsheet as name-value pairs. I
often prefer to view spreadsheets this way because it avoids
line-wrapping issues that come up with a normal row/column/cell
tabular ascii-art view.

render_ss.rb is a command line to convert a spreadsheet to EAD.

The utility class Ss_convert is in lib/util.rb. Rails specific
bookkeeping/rendering code (the controller) is in
app/controllers/ss_conv_controller.rb. The .erb HTML templates are in
the standard location app/views/ss_conv/.




<%= dsc %> in pre_dsc_header_t.erb comes from the content hash value
in the list of hashes generated during processing the spread sheet
rows.

Due to the entities and DTD referenced in the EAD XML template, the
following URLs and servers must remain active, and kept up to date.

Change notes
------------

x Documentation for both end users and developers is all in this file
(readme.html) and this is linked from the site home page.

x Include a link to the empty spreadsheet so people can download the
correct, current version. Include the file modification time in the
link text.

x rename render_csv.rb to render_ss.rb, show_csv.rb to show_ss.rb
because both can do more than just csv.

x <ead id="#{coll_hr['num']}">  vui is the num. vui also occurs in file name.

x show_csv.rb add printf max width formatting for name and add ability
  to read xlsx.

Q If an element is empty must we render it as <empty/> or can we use
<empty></empty> ?

A xmllint seems to change empty elements into the self-closing variant.

x add "num" to Accession # in prefercite

x fix both instances of <num> to use collection_num column

x add <head>Conents List</head> as first line of <dcs>

x put sample input and output from "steady" ruby and nokogiri converter into ./steady/

x simple erb text template_1.erb

x copy EADExample.csv to first_example.csv for tab-complete sanity

x show_csv.rb to show csv as name-value pairs where the name is the column name.
